Geotagged images have a spatial (a specific, typically centimeter-accurate GPS Lat/Long position) reference as well as a specific time-stamp (Year-month-day HH:MM:SS), which can be used to determine exactly where and when an occurrence of litter was identified- thus showing the location of a contributor at any point in time and potentially revealing information about the spatial patterns of a contributor or many contributors and revealing the location of hotspots and irregular occurrences of hazardous material such as drug-related litter (eg. needles, injecting equipment). A specific litter item can be shown individually and/or abstracted to a dynamically-sized hexagonal grid to analytically characterize the presence of litter, or abstractively perhaps even the illicit consumption of toxic substances. Once these images are shared with us, and only geotagged images can pass, the volunteer must properly attribute each image (eg. Determine x items of litter in x number of photos through the user of their Profile (https://openlittermap.com/profile) and once the image and its’ contents are attributed, each image must be submitted for crowdsourced verification. The verified images, their location and the time the image was captured will be mapped, spatially analyzed and the results, the images, the make/model of the device (which is an indication of spatial accuracy eg. iPhones (5+) are currently typically superior in spatial accuracy and temporal GPS-revisit frequency to Android) and their contents will be made public for guests or authenticated users of the website. Each image can account for only 1 point on the map which when clicked, will show the image which can be viewed in high-resolution, as well as its contents, the make and/or model of the device and although all images will be submitted anonymously by default, each contributor has the option to credit either their full name and/or unique Username or Organisation on the verifiable geotagged images they provide.
